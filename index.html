&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <big><big>The purpose of
this engine is to be versatile, easy to use and still powerful.
Although there are a few potentially confusing aspects about the engine,
the engine is VERY well documented and I actively make an effort to
update the engine frequently, explain all the features sufficiently and
adapt the engine according to the needs of my users. If you are looking
to make a commercial game with less effort or you do not want to touch
ANY code, it is recommended that you do not use this engine and instead
consider using engines such as Unreal or Unity engines.</big></big><br>

<h1>About the Developer</h1>
<div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There's not much to be said on this portion of the site, as this
project is about learning and the fun of programming, not about me.
However, there are a few things to know about me in order for one to
understand why I did this or that a certain way. I've been programming
Java for about 7 years now, and it's definitely my favorite programming
language (it always has been). This is primarily because I enjoy having
the ability to run my program on almost any machine and I LOVE the
portable standard library, as well as the C-Style code. You can think
what you want about Java, but I've always gotten stable, fast products
out of it. I started Java with the Eclipse IDE, but I found that
Eclipse had a few fundamental differences from my style of programming
and program structure. First off, Eclipse does not use conventions very
often in their file system. What this means is if I simply cut and
paste a bunch of .java files in the project's directory, it WILL NOT
ADD THEM. This, to me, is very infuriating that I have to register
everything I do to the IDE. I also think the Options dialogues are a
bit clunky and confusing, but that's fairly minor to me. After I
decided to stop using Eclipse I Googled "Java IDEs" and decided to try
the first result, NetBeans. I know NetBeans was a very poorly designed,
slow and clunky IDE back in the day (and has maintained a bad
reputation as a result), but if you've ever used the latest version of
it I think your opinion will change quickly on it. NetBeans, to me, is
a very portable, compatible, fast, versatile and easy-to-use IDE will
no complications, so I've been using it ever since. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you take a single glance at my code,
you'll quickly notice that I do not follow standard Java conventions (I
know, hypocrite!) , namely on bracket structures. This is a result of
porting over from C++ to Java (though I did adopt the naming
conventions, thankfully), and I also believe it makes it easier to see
where things start and end. If you also use the standard Java naming
conventions then my code structure should have no effect on your
development.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Another topic of interest would be my PRIORITIES of my
development process, so here is a numbered list!<br>
<ol>
  <li>Performance</li>
  <li>Versatility</li>
  <li>Ease-Of-Use</li>
</ol>

<h3>Personal Details</h3>
<div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As I stated above, there's not much to be said about me. I'm a
high-school developer who's been programming since I was a small child
(starting with VBasic and the like) and avid PC Gamer. I play FPS games
on Steam almost religiously. I like rock/alternative music (Pink Floyd,
Rush, Stone Temple Pilots, RHCP and the like) and comedy TV shows on
Netflix (Trailer Park Boys, Scrubs, Family Guy, Futurama, etc).</div>
