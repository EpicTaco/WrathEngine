Things to fix/edit:
- Add 3D texture loading in ClientUtils and Texture
- Use Model and Texture system for Background rendering.

Things to add:
- Audio
	|-- Research OpenAL w/ LWJGL 3.0

- Rendering Pipeline
	|-- Make the outline of the pipeline first, then add graphic functions later.
	    This step is to just lay the foundation.

- Native World/Player Systems
	|-- This is also just the foundation, no operations will be available yet.
