Things to fix/edit:
- Integrate Entity positions into rendering. e.g. Make Camera use Player locations methods or make EntityRenderer use Entity.getLocation() as position.

Things to add:
- Audio
	|-- Research OpenAL w/ LWJGL 3.0

- Native World/Player Systems
	|-- This is also just the foundation, no operations will be available yet.

- Add GUI System
        |-- Use 2D overlay rendering to create a GUI-window system.
            This is to be made BEFORE the Console.

- Console
        |-- Add a text game console in-game. (Integrate with GUI)
