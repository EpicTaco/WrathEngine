Things to fix/edit:
- Change Background and (possibly) GUI from immediate mode.


Things to add:
- Work on Savable Key Binds.

- TEXT RENDERING (Pain in the ass, let me tell you)
	|-- Research the dark depths of font conversions and micro-graphic opertions to make this possible.

- Audio
	|-- Research OpenAL w/ LWJGL 3.0

- Rendering Pipeline
	|-- Make the outline of the pipeline first, then add graphic functions later.
	    This step is to just lay the foundation.

- Native World/Player Systems
	|-- This is also just the foundation, no operations will be available yet.
