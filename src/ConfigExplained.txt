#This file is NOT meant to be cut/pasted into the etc/configs folder, though a copy can be made if you re-name it to 'game.cfg' and place it in the
#etc/configs folder. This file contains all of the possible configuration options in the default engine and all of their default values.
#Please note that any comments (denoted with a '#' at the beginning of the line) will be deleted upon saving the configuration file from within the engine.




### Display Options ###

#Set to 'true' to enable Vsync with the monitor, otherwise false.
#Be careful with this, as if the Ticks-per-second (which cannot be set in the config) is set to over your monitor's
#refresh rate, this can cause issues in timing and animation with the game. Only use if necessary.
#Default is false
DisplayVsync: false

#The type of window to create. Options are: Windowed,Fullscreen,Fullscreen_Windowed and Windowed_Undecorated
#Default is fullscreen_windowed
WindowState: fullscreen_windowed

#The Width and Height of the window's resolution, usually denoted by (WidthxHeight)
#Default is 800
Width: 800
#Default is 600
Height: 600

#The rate at which to refresh the monitor's image. Measured in Hz. When set to 0, refresh rate is automatically determined.
#Only works with fullscreen windows.
#Default is 0
DisplayRefreshRate: 0

#Determines the number of samples to be used in the window for multi-sampling. When set to 0, sampling is disabled. 
#Default is 1
DisplaySamples: 1

#Determines whether or not the window should be re-sizable by the user. Only applies in the Windowed WindowState.
#Default is true
WindowResizable: true

#Determines whether or not the window should use the configured resolution in fullscreen mode instead of monitor's maximum resolution.
#Only applies in the Fullscreen WindowState.
#Default is false
FullscreenUsesResolution: false

#Determines the Field of View of the camera if the game is in 3D Render-Mode.
#Only applies to 3D games.
#Default is 70
FOV: 70

### Other Options ###

#Determines how many times the engine should check to see if a key is still held down in a second. Increasing this will increase CPU strain, but also
#result in more accurate input handling. Value can NOT be greater than the Game's pre-defined Ticks-per-second value (which is usually 30-60).
#Setting value to 0 will set the game to check for input every tick.
#Default is 0
PersistentInputChecksPerSecond: 0

#If true, the game will attempt to load and execute jar-format java plugins in the 'AutoLoadJavaPluginsDirectory' folder.
#Default is true
AutoLoadJavaPlugins: true

#The relative directory to automatically load jar-format java plugins.
#Default is 'etc/plugins'
AutoLoadJavaPluginsDirectory: etc/plugins

#For GLFW and OpenGL libraries. Set to false as setting to true *may* cause errors.
#Default is false
APIForwardCompatMode: false

#Set to false unless you know what you're doing.
